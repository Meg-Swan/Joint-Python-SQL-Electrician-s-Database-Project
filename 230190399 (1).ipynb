    "This Jupyter notebook outlines the implementation requirements for the Python implementation part of your INF111-INF112 practical project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The notebook is broken up into four sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Required functions** -- The Python functions and functionality you are required to implement as part of your programming project.\n",
    "2. **Your implementation** -- Space for you to add your own implementation to this notebook.\n",
    "3. **Summary report generation** -- Base implementation for generating the summary report from your data, **with space for you to add your own implementation _(see details in section)_**.\n",
    "4. **Automated testing** -- Unit tests to verify that your implementation of the required functions is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NOTE** that to accomplish the goals of your project, you may need to implement functions that are not specified in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task of a programmer is to take a _specification_, which describes the behaviour a program should implement, and write the code required to produce that behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For full details of the expected behaviour and implementation standards, please refer to the [INF111-INF112 Project Assignment Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ajALWwIqV49aiv3wtLK1lqv2ObKwWIqmnUfR6c4B5rQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

    "- You are free to use your example CSV file from your Mid-Semester Check-in 1 submission (or a modified version of it) as your data source. **You are not required to submit a SQL file for INF111 Check-in 2.**\n",
    "- Please submit your _**in-progress**_ copy of this Jupyter notebook to the TurnItIn link on INF111 Blackboard.\n",
    "- You are not required to meet any specific milestones for your Check-in 2 submission, however the more code you submit the more you will be able to get feedback on.\n",

    "## **For INF111-INF112 final submission (Week 12)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For final submission you are required to use your SQLite database file for all data storage and retrieval.**\n",
    "- Your Jupyter notebook must assume that your SQLite database file is stored in the same working directory as the notebook file.\n",
    "- Please submit your _**completed**_ copy of this Jupyter notebook to the TurnItIn link on INF111 Blackboard.\n",
